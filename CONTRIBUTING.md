# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in Google Group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pytweetbot).

Here are some important resources:

  * Google News: Join our [developer list](http://groups.google.com/group/pytweetbot/)
  * Bugs? [Issues](https://github.com/nschaetti/pyTweetBot/issues) is where to report them
  * Website: [#nilsschaetti.com](http://www.nilsschaetti.com/). We're usually there during business hours.

## Testing

There is a lot of features, please test them and report us any problem.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pyTweetBot](https://github.com/pytweetbot/pytweetbot/pull/new/develop) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Thanks,
Nils Schaetti
